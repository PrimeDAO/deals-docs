1. Visit [https://deals.prime.xyz/initiate](https://deals.prime.xyz/initiate)
2. Click on <kbd>Connect to a Wallet</kbd> and accept the [Prime Deals Terms of Service](https://deals.prime.xyz/terms-of-service). Make sure you are connected to the intended network (for the moment only Ethereum Mainnet is available).
    - You need to have a compatible wallet set up. Prime Deals connects to most Ethereum wallets, including Metamask and all wallets compatible with WalletConnect. If you don't have an Ethereum wallet yet, set up a [Metamask account](https://metamask.io/) or use a WalletConnect-enabled mobile wallet like [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/).
    - You will need to fund your wallet with some ETH for paying the transaction costs needed to setup the deal. Most wallets will give you instructions on how to acquire those tokens and ETH.
3. Click on <kbd>Select</kbd> in the Token Swap box to initiate the wizard. (In the future other modules will become available).
4. In the very first step of the wizard you will have to pick between **Open Proposal** and **Partnered Deal**. If you don’t have a prospective Partner DAO that you want to bring to table yet select <kbd>Open Proposal</kbd>. In this way you will you be able to launch a proposal and receive many offers from various prospective partners. In case you already have a Partner DAO choose <kbd>Partnered Deal</kbd>.
