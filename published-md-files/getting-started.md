# Introduction

## What is Prime Deals?

**Prime Deals** is a platform to host and facilitate various types of DAO to DAO (D2D) negotiations. With our platform any DAO can easily propose, discuss and ratify agreements, and execute the deal on-chain.

At first, Prime Deals will feature the **Token Swap**, a module that allows DAOs to execute trustless token swaps among them with customized vesting options. Prime Deals will progressively release further modules to facilitate additional types of contract-based interactions such as **Joint Venture** in the near future and **Co-liquidity Pool** later on.

## Why should I use Prime Deals?

Prime Deals have numerous advantages as compared to negotiating deals with cumbersome coordination processes and bespoke contract interactions. If you want to learn more about Prime Deals smart contract architecture, please see <a href="/documentation/SmartContractArchitecture">here</a>.


Here you find a detailed list of features that you can find in Prime Deals modules. 

### Prime Deals Features

**Jumpstart your Deal with a Streamlined Proposal Interface**

- Simplify complex proposal-making with a robust interface that enables you to clearly define the terms of your proposed agreement, while gathering and synthesizing all important information you need to proceed with the negotiation.

**Explore the best options with and Open Proposal or bring your Partner DAO to the table**

- an **Open Proposal** allows you to launch a new proposal that is open to any DAO that might want to propose a partnership deal based off of the offer you initially create.
- a **Partnered Deal** allows you to bring to the negotiation table two DAOs that are already aspiring to close a deal, and it simplifies the process of refine, finalize, and execute their agreement on-chain.

**Clear Roles in the Negotiation phase**

- Every deal has one and only one **Proposal Lead** who is responsible for kickstarting the deal by drafting the initial proposal, initiating the Funding phase once the deal is approved by the DAOs’ Representatives, cancelling the deal, and editing the deal.
- Each DAO involved in a deal can bring up to five **Deal Representatives** who can discuss, refine and ratify clauses, and easily vote to approve or reject the deal, as well as deposit, withdraw funds, and claim tokens on behalf of their DAO.

**Create On-Chain Conditions for the Partnering DAO to Execute Token Allocations**

- Our modules go beyond traditional escrow mechanisms by allowing more flexibility during the negotiation operating more like existing, real-world negotiations. Participants can add clauses in real-time to enable social agreements that support on-chain interactions.
- The complexity of collaborations is decided by the partners in the deal who are specifying the clauses, and they may choose anything between a single shallow condition like a mere swap of tokens, or deeply nested, granular conditions that involves other mechanisms like oracle networks.

**Recover allocated funding if the Deal doesn’t go through**

- When the deadline of the funding is not met by both parties, deal representatives can withdraw any funds they may already have deposited. This reduces significant negotiation overhead as there is no possibility of financial loss. Either the token swap occurs, with the necessary funding being correctly directed, or it doesn’t, and the funding Deal Representatives get to withdraw their deposit on behalf of their DAO.

**Prime Deals is governance framework agnostic**

- It doesn’t matter if you’re running on <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gnosis Safe</a>, <a href="https://daohaus.club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daohaus</a>, or <a href="https://daostack.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAOstack</a> — any governance framework will work with Prime Deals.

### How is Prime Deals unique?

Negotiations are omnipresent in our human society. In order to reduce coordination & transaction costs, ever more appropriate norms, protocols and channels have emerged throughout our evolution. It is possible to observe the results of this evolution in fields such as international relations, game theory, social choice theory and network theory to name a few. Auctions, voting modules, and curated lists are all games which can be considered as generative negotiation protocols.

DAOs are programmable organizations that possess the unique organizational capability to leverage negotiation protocols to trade, merge, establish or dissolve relations according to any logic afforded through the use of smart contracts. DAOs are representing a significant reset in value-generating human organizations as their embedded programmability and inherent cultural drivers make the creation of shared incentives structures a core tenet at any scale and level of the organization. As such, DAOs have both a deeper and wider space of cooperation than joint-stock companies, as they are able to make cooperation more pervasive and more affordable to execute.

Indeed, negotiation protocols are also the backbone of decentralized governance. Every DAO deploys their own set of parameters for consensus formation with its community, infrastructure and use-case in mind.  Whilst the current technological landscape of negotiation interfaces is a nightmare that is not matching the enthusiasm and ambitions of this space, the general complexity for DAOs to coordinate with a constantly growing, loosely coupled and horizontally managed team of diverse value-driven talents within and across organizational boundaries is incredibly challenging, time-consuming and mostly untamed.

With Prime Deals, PrimeDAO aim at simplifying these mechanism so that DAOs can evaluate proposals without having to re-define the medium of negotiation each time. Besides, by abstracting a generalized model on how to set conditions and outcomes, with Prime Deals, proposals can be extended to serve a large variety of complex contracts type and organizational topologies.

**Once DAOs can interface each other through these negotiation mechanisms, PrimeDAO expects the emergence of further use-cases such as mergers, joint ventures, community swaps and polycentric policy patterns.**

Indeed, PrimeDAO believe that the rapidly evolution of web3 infrastructure and the massive surge of crypto-native organizations are paving a not-so-distant future where DAOs can endogenously produce a self-sovereign, crypto-institutional control network of their own that is comparable—if not even succeeding in the long term—the value generated by transnational corporate control networks. With Prime Deals, PrimeDAO ultimately wants to foster the consolidation of an institutionalized “crypto-native commons” made of DAOs trade, mergers and acquisitions. Prime Deals is projected to become the standard set of interfaces and protocols to serve and encourage a thriving continuous evolution of DAO-to-DAO interactions for the years ahead.
