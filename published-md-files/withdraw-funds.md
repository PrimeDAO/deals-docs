## Withdraw funds

As a Deal Representative, if you have already funded your part of a deal, but for some reasons the deal turns to be not fully funded by the end of the Funding period, you can withdraw your deposit by scrolling at the bottom of the Funding page. You will see an area with the list of all deposits currently existing in the deal escrow. You can simply click on the ‘WITHDRAW’ button on the side of each token type listing and confirming the transaction that will be prompted in your wallet.
