In an Open Proposal, anyone with a connected wallet can discuss the clauses, in fact Open Proposals cannot be private. On a Partnered Deal only the Deal Representatives and the Proposal Lead can discuss, irrespective of whether the deal is public or private.

To discuss the clauses of a deal follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure you are connected with your wallet
2. Visit the page of the deal you intend to discuss
3. Scroll to the ‘Deal Clauses’ area
4. Hover on the right side of the clause that you want to discuss and click ‘BEGIN A DISCUSSION’. You will be directed to the comment area of the deal page.
5. You can add your comment by typing your text and when you are done pressing the button ‘COMMENT’. You will be prompted by your wallet for a signature, sign it and shorty after you will see your comment in the discussion area. The comments you make are associated with your wallet address.
6. If you already find someone else comment, you have the possibility to upvote or downvote their comment, and to reply in a threaded conversation to their comment by clicking ‘REPLY’
