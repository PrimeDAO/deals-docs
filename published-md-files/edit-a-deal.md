As a Proposal Lead you can edit an existing deal by simply hitting the <kbd>EDIT</kbd> button on the deal page. 

Amended the parts of the proposal that you mean to change.

Review all the information in the summary page that will be prompted at the end of the wizard and hit the <kbd>SUBMIT</kbd> button. 

You will be prompted to provide a signature with your wallet. Sign it and youâ€™re done.

Always remember that editing a Deal reset all votes already casted by the Deal Representatives (except if you merely change the privacy settings).
