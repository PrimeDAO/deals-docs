As a Deal Representative you have the exclusive right to cast a vote on the deal, either to accept or reject the deal.

Note that a Deal Representative can also abstain by not voting as this action is not mandatory. However, keep in mind that unless the Proposal Lead edits the deal, the Deal Representative won’t be able to revert to a neutral un-voted state if they have already casted a vote. In this case, voting will be reset for all Deal Representatives. 

You can change your vote as many times as you want while the Negotiating phase is active on but beware the deal can only move forward from the Negotiating phase to the Funding phase when at least 50% of the Deal Representative(s) per each DAO have cast an affirmative vote.

To cast a vote you simply have to click on <kbd>ACCEPT</kbd> or <kbd>DECLINE</kbd> in the ‘Vote’ box that you find on the top right of the deal page.
