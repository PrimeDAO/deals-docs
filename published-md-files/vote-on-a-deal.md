As a Deal Representative you have the exclusive right to cast a vote on the deal, either to accept or reject the deal.

A Deal Representative can also abstain by non voting as this action is not mandatory for a Deal Representative. However, keep in mind that after your vote is casted, you won’t be able to revert to a neutral un-voted state, unless the Proposal Lead edits the deal. In this case then voting will be reset and the state of all Deal Representative vote will be in a neutral un-voted state again.

You can change your vote as many times as you want until the Negotiating phase is going on but beware the deal can only move forward from the Negotiating phase to the Funding phase when at least 50% of the Deal Representatives per each DAO have casted an affirmative vote.

To cast a vote you simply have to click on <kbd>ACCEPT</kbd> or <kbd>DECLINE</kbd> in the ‘Vote’ box that you find on the top right of the deal page.
