## What is a DAOplomat?

The notion of ‘DAOplomat’ refers to any entity internal or external to a DAO who brings the two parties together to make a deal happen, and may offer themselves as a Proposal Lead. 

DAOplomats are intermediating agents between two or more DAOs that facilitate, lead, and negotiate deals and partnerships between them by coordinating and communicating with the representatives of each organization.

Soon, DAOplomats will be able to earn rewards. This upcoming feature makes it financially interesting for people to intercept and foster potential deal making between DAOs.
