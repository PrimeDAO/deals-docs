# Make an Offer to an Open Proposal

If you are interested to submit a DAO as a partner to an Open Proposal you can follow these simple steps below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you are connected with your wallet by following the pre-requisite step <a href="/documentation/INITIATEADEAL">here</a>.

Visit the page of the Open Proposal you want to make an offer for.

You will find a box with a button <kbd>MAKE AN OFFER</kbd>.  This will create an offer template based on the Open Proposal you have selected in which you can add your DAO and Token Details and edit the clauses. When you create a new deal based off an Open Proposal, it’s highly recommended that you to inform the counter party that you are interested in negotiating with them.

You will also be able to edit different sections depending on how the Open Proposal administrative rights were set:

- If the original Proposal Lead has retained their administrative rights **you will NOT be able to change** the Proposal Lead address and the Deal Privacy. In this case you can skip the next step ‘Lead Details’ in this tutorial.
- if the original Proposal Lead has let go of their administrative rights **you will be able to change** the Proposal Lead address and the Deal Privacy as well. In this case you can optionally change those details by following the next step ‘Lead Details’ in this tutorial.
- In both cases you can always tweak the Primary DAO Token Details, and cannot change the Primary DAO Details nor the Primary DAO representative addresses.

### Lead Details

*This step is optional and relevant only if the original Proposal Lead has waived their administrative rights.*

1. Provide the Ethereum address for the Proposal Lead who will acquire the administrative rights of the deal. If you are already connected to the app with the wallet of the intended Proposal Lead, just click <kbd>MAKE ME THE PROPOSAL LEAD</kbd>. 
    - To learn more about the role and rights of a Proposal Lead please see <a href="/documentation/TokenSwapFAQ#/proposal-lead">here</a>.
2. Provide the **Contact E-mail (optional)**
3. Decide whether you wanna keep this deal and the conversations private, or if you rather keep these publicly accessible.
    - Toggle this option on if you DON’T want the public to see what is being discussed by the DAOs. This will make all conversations of this Partnered Deal only visible by the Proposal Lead and the involved Deal Representatives.
    - You can always turn the deal to public during the Negotiation phase or after the deal is ratified. Note that conversations previously held in private will remain private, even if the deal is turned public. Contrary to an Open Proposal, in a Partnered Deal only Proposal Lead and Deal Representatives can discuss the clauses, regardless if the deal is public or private.
    - A negotiated deal that has been turned public can be turned back into private, and vice versa.
    - Move into the ‘Partner DAO’ section of the wizard

### Partner DAO Details

In this section you can fill in the details of the Partner DAO. This is the DAO for which the offer to the Open Proposal is created for.

1. Provide the **Partner DAO Name**
2. Provide the **Partner DAO Treasury Address**, which is the address that will receive the tokens from the other DAO after the swap
3. Provide the **Partner DAO Avatar**: a public URL to a small JPG, GIF, PNG or BMP formats image with square aspect ratio with a recommended size of 400x400px and maximum 5MB file size.
4. Provide the addresses of the **Partner DAO Representatives**. To learn more on the role of the DAO Representatives please see <a href="/documentation/TokenSwapFAQ#/representatives">here</a>.

### Token Details

In the **Token Details** section of the wizard, you can then review and tweak the parameters of the token(s) that have been previously set by the original Proposal Lead for the Primary DAO. 

Remember that each DAO can offer up to 2 token types.

First, add the Token details for the Primary DAO, or if already present review and optionally amend them. Then, move on the Partner DAO step and fill the Token details for the Partner DAO. 

Click on <kbd>ADD TOKEN +</kbd>, this will open up a box in which you’ll be able to input the Token details.

For each type of token that a DAO is open to swap you would need to provide these details:

1. The native address of the token to swap.
2. The **Total Amount of Tokens to Swap** which defines the total amount of tokens that will be transferred to the other DAO during the swap. You can adjust this amount at any time before the beginning of the Funding phase of the deal.
3. The **Instant Transfer Setup and the Vesting setup**
    - Toggle the vesting schedule to define how much of the tokens are instantly transferred to the other DAO versus how much of your token are vested once the deal is executed on-chain. The Instant Transfer amount will be immediately sent to the other DAO's treasury address, whereas the Vested amount is the amount of tokens that will be released progressively throughout the total Vesting period defined in the Vesting setup in the next step below.
    - If you have defined a Vested amount, once the deal is executed on-chain, that amount will start to be released linearly throughout the Vesting period. If you define a Cliff period, tokens will not be claimable before the Cliff period ends. If you don't define a Cliff period, tokens will be progressively available to be claimed on a daily basis after the Vesting period starts.
4. The **Funding Period**
    - In this step you can setup the non-extendable number of days that both parties have to complete to fully fund and execute the swap. If the Deal Representatives and the Proposal Lead have failed to do that within this agreed upon timeframe, the deal is considered failed. Make sure that you set a reasonable Funding Period that takes in consideration the time needed to pass the deals through the governance processes of both parties.

### Terms

In the Terms section you have to provide all the important clauses of your proposal (max. 10). Please be specific and clear so that everyone can understand the terms of the agreement between the parties involved. This document can serve as a single source of truth for future reference.

1. Click the button <kbd>ADD CLAUSE +</kbd>
2. Write the text of your clause (max 500 ch.)
3. Click <kbd>SAVE</kbd> to save this clause and move to the next.
4. You can edit a clause with the <kbd>EDIT</kbd> button.
5. Make sure have written and saved all clauses

Click <kbd>PROCEED</kbd> at the bottom of the page to move onto the next section

### Submit

In this section you can visualize a summary of all the information you have input. Please, inspect all parts of the summary byword and make sure they precisely reflect what you want to propose. If you spot an error, you can navigate to previous sections of this wizard to correct them before submitting your proposal. It's your responsibility to verify that all the relevant information is correct (e.g. Treasury address, Deal Representative addresses, Token addresses, Token amount, etc.). PrimeDAO don't offer any validation process to verify your input. For instance, it cannot verifies whether a treasury address is related to a certain DAO. 

When you are ready click <kbd>SUBMIT</kbd>. Please be patient as it might require a moment to register your deal. Once successfully registered you will see a box with a confirmation message. You can now visit the deal page and share the link to have other people join.
