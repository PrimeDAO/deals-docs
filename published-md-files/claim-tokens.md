If the deal has been executed on chain, as a Representative you can claim existing vested tokens after the Cliff period has ended (if existing). 

Follow these simple steps:

1. Scroll to ‘Token Swap Status’ area on the middle section of the deal page 
2. Click on the button <kbd>GO TO CLAIM</kbd>. 
3. You will be redirected to the Funding page in which you will find an area listing the tokens that you can claim on behalf of the DAO you are representing.
4. Wait for the Cliff period to end, if existing. 
5. Click <kbd>CLAIM TOKENS</kbd> and confirm the associated transaction that will be prompted in your wallet.
6. Wait for the confirmation of the transaction.
