If all funding from both DAOs has been successfully deposited, both Proposal Lead as well as any Deal Representative can execute a deal by following these simple steps:

1. Scroll to ‘Token Swap Status’ area on the middle section of the deal page 
2. Click on the button <kbd>EXECUTE SWAP</kbd>. 
3. When clicking <kbd>EXECUTE SWAP</kbd> you will be prompted with a modal box that ask you to confirm the action. When you confirm the action you will be prompted from your wallet to confirm the associated transaction. 
4. Await the confirmation of the transaction, if successful you will be prompted with another modal box that confirm the swap has been executed on-chain.

Remember that in order to finalize the deal the execution needs to happen before the funding period expires.
