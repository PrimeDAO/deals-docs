## Start Funding

As a Proposal Lead you can start the Funding phase when at least 50% of the Deal Representatives per each DAO have casted an affirmative vote. To do so, simply follow these steps:

1. Click the ‘START FUNDING’ button from the ‘Vote’ box on the top right side of the deal page.
2. Please BEWARE that after you start funding, the deal cannot be edited. You can edit the deal at this point if you wish. Also BEWARE that editing the deal will reset voting status, and that you are responsible for informing the deal participants of this change, and for getting them to cast their votes again.
3. If you decide to go on with starting the funding, you will be prompted by your wallet to confirm an on-chain transaction. Confirm and wait for the transaction confirmation. If you still see the button ‘START FUNDING’ after you have completed this step, simply refresh the page once the transaction has been confirmed. 
4. You should then see a ‘GO TO FUNDING’ button instead of the ‘START FUNDING’. You can monitor the progress of each DAO funding from this page.
