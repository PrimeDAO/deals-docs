### Token Swap Proposal

1. Provide a clear **Proposal Title** that capture the essence of the deal you want to offer (max 60 ch.).
2. Provide a brief outline of the Token Swap deal in the **Proposal Summary** box (max 350 ch.).
3. In the **Proposal Description** provide the details, background and features of your Token Swap proposal. Explain why it's particularly valuable or unique, and what kind of DAOs you are looking to partner with. 

### Lead Details

1. Provide the Ethereum address for the Proposal Lead who will gain administrative rights of the deal. If you are already connected to the app with the wallet of the intended Proposal Lead, just click <kbd>MAKE ME THE PROPOSAL LEAD</kbd>. 
    - To learn more about the role and rights of a Proposal Lead please see <a href="/documentation/TokenSwapFAQ/#proposal-lead">here</a>.
2. Provide the **Contact E-mail (optional)**
3. Select if you want to **Keep Administrative Rights with all incoming offers.** It’s highly recommended that you transfer your administrative rights only if you anticipate many incoming offers for this proposal and won't have time to manage them. For a list of pros and cons please see <a href="/documentation/TokenSwapFAQ/#keeping-admin-rights">here</a>.
    - Toggle this option on if you would like to retain the Proposal Lead role to yourself. This will allow you to continue manage all the offers incoming to your Open Proposal.
    - If instead you toggle this option off, you will transfer your administrative rights to the prospect Partner DAO. In this case the Partner DAO will have to register a new Proposal Lead address to which the administrative rights will be transferred to.
4. Decide whether you wanna keep all incoming offers to your proposal private, or if you rather keep these publicly accessible.
    - Toggle this option on if you want the incoming counterproposals to be only visible to the Proposal Lead and the involved Deal Representatives, and not visible to the public.
    - You can always turn the deal to public during the Negotiation phase to receive feedback from the wider community, or after the deal is ratified. Note that conversations previously held in private will remain private, even if the deal is turned public.
    - A negotiated deal that has been turned public can be turned back into private, and vice versa. A Proposal Lead can do that anytime on the dashboard. If the deal was privately negotiated and executed, it’s highly recommended that you to make the deal public when the deal is complete.

### Primary DAO Details

Fill in the details of the Primary DAO. This is the DAO for which the original proposal is initiated for.

1. Provide the **Primary DAO Name**
2. Provide the **Primary DAO Treasury Address**, which is the address that will receive the tokens from the other DAO after the swap
3. Provide the **Primary DAO Avatar**: a public URL to a small JPG, GIF, PNG or BMP formats image with square aspect ratio with a recommended size of 400x400px and maximum 5MB file size.
4. Provide the addresses of the **Primary DAO Representatives**.  To learn more on the role of the DAO Representatives please see <a href="/documentation/TokenSwapFAQ/#representatives">here</a>.

### Token details

In this section of the wizard you have to fill in the details of the token(s) that the Primary DAO want to swap.

Please note that filling out this section is **OPTIONAL** for Open Proposals: you can start filling the information you have and you can add more details later.

For each type of token that the DAO is open to swap you’d need to provide these details:

1. The native address of the token to swap.
2. The **Total Amount of Tokens to Swap** which defines the total amount of tokens that will be transferred to the other DAO during the swap. You can adjust this amount at any time before the beginning of the Funding phase of the deal.
3. The **Instant Transfer Setup and the Vesting setup**
    - Toggle the vesting schedule to define how much of the tokens are instantly transferred to the other DAO versus how much of your token are vested once the deal is executed on-chain. The **Instant Transfer** amount will be immediately sent to the other DAO's treasury address, whereas the **Vested** amount is the amount of tokens that will be released progressively throughout the total **Vesting period** defined in the Vesting setup in the next step below.
    - If you have defined a Vested amount, once the deal is executed on-chain, that amount will start to be released linearly throughout the Vesting period. If you define a **Cliff** period, tokens will not be claimable before the Cliff period ends. If you don't define a Cliff period, tokens will be progressively available to be claimed on a daily basis after the Vesting period starts.
4. The **Funding Period**
    - In this step you can setup the non-extendable number of days that both parties have to complete to fully fund and execute the swap. If the Deal Representatives and the Proposal Lead have failed to do that within this agreed upon timeframe, the deal is considered failed. Make sure that you set a reasonable Funding Period that takes in consideration the time needed to pass the deals through the governance processes of both parties.

### Terms

In this section you have to provide all the important clauses of your proposal (max. 10). Please be specific and clear so that everyone can understand the terms of the agreement between the parties involved. This document can serve as a single source of truth for future reference.

1. Click the button <kbd>ADD CLAUSE +</kbd>
2. Write the text of your clause (max 500 ch.)
3. Click <kbd>SAVE</kbd> to save this clause and move to the next.
4. You can edit a clause with the <kbd>EDIT</kbd> button.
5. Make sure have written and saved all clauses

Click <kbd>PROCEED</kbd> at the bottom of the page to move onto the next section

### Submit

In this section you can visualize a summary of all the information you have input. Please, inspect all parts of the summary byword and make sure they precisely reflect what you want to propose. If you spot an error, you can navigate to previous sections of this wizard to correct them before submitting your proposal. It's your responsibility to verify that all the relevant information is correct (e.g. Treasury address, Deal Representative addresses, Token addresses, Token amount, etc.). PrimeDAO don't offer any validation process to verify your input. For instance, it cannot verifies whether a treasury address is related to a certain DAO. 

When you are ready click <kbd>SUBMIT</kbd>. Please be patient as it might require a moment to register your deal. Once successfully registered you will see a box with a confirmation message. You can now visit the deal page and share the link to have other people join.
